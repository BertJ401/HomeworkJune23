Code Quiz Program

So this was a lot to work on.  Like the last assignment, I took what we learned in class, then watched a dozen people do similar projects, read 18 tutorials, and then went back and worked on a module here, a module there.  I also tried different styles and methods, opting out of buttons on the main game page (I was going to use a Millionaire background), and then played around learning how to create an opacity that doesn't carry to children in css, getting deep into split functions so I randomized the order of the questions, how to read about importing and exporting javascript modules when all I had to do was declare my questions array file (but hey, now I'm think, could I have made this one page that way?), how to play sounds on events (although a couple I couldn't figure out why they didn't work, but it was outside the scope), etc.  In all it was a fun project.

There are definitely things I could work on and improve.
